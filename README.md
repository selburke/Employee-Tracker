# Employee-Tracker

The Employee Tracker allows the user to add the department & role of employees, as well as add new employees.

For this project, I used MySQL to create a Schema & database. I then used Javascript & the Inquirer NPM package to create a Node.JS Application which allows the user to interact and complete various prompts for adding new data.
